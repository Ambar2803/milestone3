            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! I'm Ambar, an enthusiastic Information Technology sophomore at Kennesaw State University, hoping to work in the Data Science or Cybersecurity industry.</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm a part of the University Information Technology Services team, where I help troubleshoot tech issues and support A/V equipment on campus. I also serve as the Event Coordinator for the International Student Association, planning and organizing fun events for students on campus!</p>
            <p>I love learning and taking on new challenges. Whether it's coding, organizing events, or exploring cybersecurity, I'm all about gaining real-world experience that will set me up for a successful career.</p>
            <p>I'm actively looking for internships that will allow me to apply what I've learned and grow in the IT industry. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or have any questions!</p>
